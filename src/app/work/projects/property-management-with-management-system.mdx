## Challenges and Learnings

Without a doubt, one of the greatest challenges was accurately placing the map pin at the exact location of the property on the map rendered by the API. This required a deep understanding of the Google Maps API and its integration with our application. We had to ensure that the pin placement was precise, which involved meticulous testing and adjustments to the coordinates based on user input. This experience taught us the importance of attention to detail and thorough testing in software development.
